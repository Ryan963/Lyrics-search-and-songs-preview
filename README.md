# Lyrics-search-and-songs-preview
you can search for any song by typing the name of the song or the artist in the search bar
the search results will display all the songs that contain the search keyword 
to go to the next or previous set of results press next/prev buttons at the bottom of the page
to display the lyrics and be able to play 30 seconds of the song press the get lyrics button under 
the song image and you will get a music player to play a preview of the song  
The project uses a custom music player with an animation on the logo picture 
this custom player works like any other music player where you can skip/pause/play the song
under the music player there will be the lyrics of the song
# Note
the ovh api is having some problems when fetching the lyrics or the music of the song so it might show that 
lyrics is not available for the song and that is because it could not get the lyrics 
same for the audio of the song. 
I will be replacing this api as soon as I find another one that will give me better results. 
Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.
